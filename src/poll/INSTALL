BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------

1) Edit the Makefile, adjusting any necessary definitions. Pay specific
   attention to the value of PREFIX and the compiler settings.
2) Type "make" to build the "libpoll.a" and "libpoll.so" libraries.
3) Type "make install" to install the shared and static libraries in
   $(PREFIX)/lib (default: /usr/local/lib) and the poll.h header file
   in $(PREFIX)/include (default: /usr/local/include)


USING THE POLL EMULATOR
-----------------------

Compiling:

	To compile a program that wants the poll.h header file, you need
	to include the appropriate "-I" option on the compiler command line.
	If you set PREFIX to "/usr/local", then use "-I/usr/local/include".
	For instance:

		cc -c -I/usr/local/include mypollprog.c

Linking:

	To link a program that uses poll, you need to link against the
	static or shared version of the library you built and installed.
	Use the "-L" and "-l" options:

		cc -o mypollprog mypollprog.o -L/usr/local/lib -lpoll

        If you need to force static linkage, add "-static" (with gcc) to
	force use of "libpoll.a":

		cc -o mypollprog mypollprog.o -L/usr/local/lib -lpoll -static

POSSIBLE ISSUES
---------------

1. John Gilmore <gnu@toad.com> encountered a linking problem on Mac OS X
   10.5 (Leopard). Note that I have not seen this problem on my 10.4
   (Tiger) Mac:

       We couldn't merely compile our code and link it with poll.c and have
       it work; we got a conflict with the system library:

       /usr/bin/ld: warning multiple definitions of symbol _poll
       /var/tmp//ccSgmsaN.o definition of _poll in section (__TEXT,__text)
       /usr/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin8/4.0.0/../../../libSystem.dylib(poll.So) definition of _poll

       Instead we added -Dpoll=myfakepoll when compiling routines that call
       poll(), and when compiling poll.c itself, so there'd be no name
       conflict.

   If you encounter this problem:

   a) Uncomment the POLL_RENAME definition in the Makefile, rebuild the
      poll emulator library, and reinstall it.
   b) Be sure to add -Dpoll=pollemu to the C compilation command line for
      any program you write that uses the poll emulator.
